# Machine-Learning-for-DeFi-Credit-Risk-Assesment
Utilizing a diverse dataset from blockchains like Ethereum, with data preprocessing, we extract DeFi-specific features for transaction statistics. We apply machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, CNN) to predict wallet liquidations, using accuracy and AUC for evaluation.
